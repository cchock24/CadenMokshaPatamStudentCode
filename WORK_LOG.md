| August 29   |  2:50-3:00   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I made a fuction that finds the largest ladder |
| September 2 |  8:50-9:20   | I made a bunch of functions that I think will be helpful to solve this problems set. I have to current issues the fact that I can't use my non-static functions in the static instance of the initial method. 2 I have no clue how to go about finding the best path |
| September 2 | 9:20 - 9:40  |                                                                                                                                                                                       I thought about how to find the best path. I also made a couple more functions |
| September 4 | 3:30 - 4:00  |                                                                                        Reviewed the MazeSolver BFS to get ideas. Started by initializing a board of a new class I made. I now need to figure out how to keep track of turn when I reach each square. |
| September 4 | 4:00  - 4:20 |                                                                                                                                                                                    I just need to determine how to figure out what turn it is when I reach a square. |
| September 6 |  3:40-4:00   |                                                                                                                                                                                                       Switched the Board, so it starts at 0. Did a lot of debugging. |
